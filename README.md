## My process

Built this locally and pushed to github when I was done.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

For this project I decided to overlap the product image with a translucent layer containing the view icon.

I learned is: I was rusty on overlapping items in grid ! Also got some practice with flexbox, which I know little about. Mostly what I learned is I don't know how to make a responsive website.

I also learned about opacity vs visibility: hidden. Couldn't get visibility:hidden to work, but opacity worked just fine.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Need to research responsive designs, especially as it pretains to card layouts
